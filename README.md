# Capital-Asset-Pricing-Model
CAPM Model for the chosen risky and risk-free assets

1. Choose a risk-free asset, such as a government bond, and note its current yield.
2. Choose any 10 risky assets from the market (stocks, bonds, etc). You can keep the same
assets you used for the previous project or choose new assets.

3. Use the CAPM formula to calculate the expected return for each of your 10 risky assets.
4.Calculate the Capital market line (CML) equation using CAPM model. Plot the efficient
frontier and CML.
5. Identify the tangency point on efficient frontier where CML touches it. Discuss what this
point represents and its significance.
6. Choose 3 of your risky assets and calculate individual security market lines.
7. Calculate relevant performance measures (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio) for each of
your optimized portfolios and compare them to individual assets. Discuss the implications of
these measures in evaluating portfolio performance.

BONUS: Compare and contrast the portfolios constructed using Markowitz and CAPM
approaches. What are the key insights gained from each method?
